// keyword  vs word
Keyword reserved words in a language
words have no meaning in laguage

//VARIABLE AND CONSTANT
Variabe are used to store data in program .It value can be change
constant don't change
const-used to assing constant value to a variable
var-we can change variable store in var

//HOISTING
Variable and Function are hoisted in Javascript
Variable  and Function can be used before it is declared
 Examples:
 1>var x=5;                     output
 var y=7;                     x=5
 console.log("x=",x);         y=7
  console.log("y=",y);
  
2>var x=5;
console.log("x="x);          output:
console.log("y=",y);         x=5
var y =7                     y=undefined--->why? only declaration is hoited not intialization

3>
  var x=5;                     output
 var y;                       x=5
 console.log("x=",x);         y=undefined
 console.log("y=",y);
 y=7;
 This happens because of phase I of memory creation phase in which in this all the variables are allocated undefined value
undefined- exist but value is not known
notdefined- doesnot exist.

//TYPES in js

 //Primitive and Refernce
 
 primitives= string ,null,undefined,boolean // actual copy is created
 reference=[ ],{ },( ) //data on copy is directly not copied but refrences is passed 
examples of refernces:
                                   output
var a=[12,13]                       b=[12]
var b=a;//reference is passed       but a=[12] because refernce was passed on
b.pop();

//CONDITIONALS 
if- else   else if

//Loops 
1>for     //see syntax
2>while

//FUNCTIONS
  enhances code reusability.
ex-
let x = myFunction(4, 3);
function myFunction(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
arguments-real value given to function
parameters-variables that store the value of the arguments

//Arrays
used to stotre related data.
var arr=[11,45,67,54]
//PUSH POP SHIFT UNSHIFT SPLICE
push(): Add elements to the end of an Array
pop(): Remove an element from end of an Array
shift(): Remove an Element from the front of an Array
unshift(): Add elements to the front of an Array
 splice

const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];   
// At position 2, remove 1 item, add "Lemon" and "Kiwi"
fruits.splice(2, 1, "Lemon", "Kiwi");
output
he splice() method adds or removes array elements.
Banana,Orange,Lemon,Kiwi,Mango

//Objects
have key and value pair
All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects
const person = {firstName:"John", 
lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};

JavaScript Objects are Mutable
const x = person;  // Will not create a copy of person.
The object x is not a copy of person. It is person. 
Both x and person are the same object.
const person = {
  firstName:"John",
  lastName:"Doe",
  age:50, eyeColor:"blue"
}
//Updating Object 
const x = person;
x.age = 10;      // Will change both x.age and person.age
